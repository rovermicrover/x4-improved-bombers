# About

Bombers in Vanilla are worse bombers than Frigates and Corvettes. Frigates have more capacity, and Corvettes have more launches.

This mod aims to fix that. It Allows Bombers To Use Missile Turrets And Buffs Their Missile Hold To 100, except the Minotaur Raider which isn't fully a bomber has had its possible hold only buffed to 50.

This has bombers matching Frigates capacity, and outclassing Corvettes launcher count.

# Notes

Note 1: The medium turret launchers for medium ships are different blueprints than the ones for large ships. If you have already bought the launcher turrets blueprints this will ensure the ones for the medium ships are given to you. If you haven't you will get both the large and medium version when you purchase from the faction representative.

Note 2: to change missile type for the turret launchers on the top middle of your screen, where the turret behavior icons are, click the bottom icon for each turret.

# What Is Modified?

* In all the layout files for M ships the turrets are patched to ensure only bombers can use the missile turrets.
* Patched the bomber ships macros to give them more missile storage.
* Patched the library ware file to allow for blueprints for the turret missile launchers for m ships.
* Patched the library icon file to ensure the turret missile launchers have icons in the equipment menu.
* Added an MD file to ensure no issue with blueprint miss match.
